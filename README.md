 Exercise 1:
 From sklearn.datasets import the California housing dataset (please see link below). Read
 the 8 features that are the independent, i.e., predictor variables. The last column is the target,
 i.e., response variable. Read every 10th row from all columns-if you read all rows the 3D plot,
 needed for Ex. 2, will take time to complete. Using Multiple Linear Regression, compute the
 linear regression coefficients and y-intercept. Predict the Median House Value given:
 8.3153, 41.0, 6.894423, 1.053714, 323.0, 2.533576, 37.88,-122.23.

 Exercise 2:
 Using the same dataset and, having kept only the first two features from the dataset, perform
 Multiple Linear Regression and plot the 3D graph between the two features and the target,
 i.e., response variable. In addition, on the same graph, plot a 3D scatter plot between the same
 features and target variable.

 Exercise 3:
 Using the entire dataset from Ex. 1, scale your data using Standardization. Find which
 coefficient carries the most weight, irrespective of its sign, and print its name.

 Exercise 4:
 Using the entire dataset from Ex. 1, drop the Longitude and Latitude features, and then create
 a pairplot for the six remaining features.
